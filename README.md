# String Library

I created this assignment on Nov 8th, 2024. What I learned from this assignment is that the alpha is for the letters and digits is for numbers. The lower and upper str is to identify how to use upper and lowercase letters.  The rest of them were kind of complicated to understand but I am still learning about it and how to use it properly.
