# String Library

I created this assignment on Nov 8th, 2024. What I learned from this assignment is that the alpha is for the letters and digits is for numbers. The lower and upper str is to identify how to use upper and lowercase letters. find_chr and find_str is used for return the index of the first occurrence of a character and locate the first occurrence of a substring within a string. the last two replace_chr and replace_str are used for replaceing a single character with another character at one or more positions in the string and replaceing a specific substring in a string with a different substring. we also learned about ragr(len(s)): and how you should be able to use it is by  get the index and then access the element at that index. So to summeriz what I was trying to say is We use functions like is_alpha, is_digit, to_lower, to_upper, find_chr, find_str, replace_chr, and replace_str to perform common operations on strings. These functions help in checking the type of characters (e.g., is_alpha checks if characters are alphabetic, is_digit checks if they are digits), manipulating string case (to_lower and to_upper for changing case), and searching or replacing parts of a string (find_chr and find_str locate characters or substrings, while replace_chr and replace_str are used to replace characters or substrings). These operations are fundamental for text processing, data validation, and string manipulation tasks, enabling efficient handling of strings in programs.Those are what I learned for my assignment library.py week 7.
