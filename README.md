# String Library

I created this assignment on Nov 8th, 2024. What I learned from this assignment is that the alpha is for the letters and digits is for numbers. The lower and upper str is to identify how to use upper and lowercase letters.  find_chr and find_str is used for return the index of the first occurrence of a character and locate the first occurrence of a substring within a string. the last two replace_chr and replace_str are used for replaceing a single character with another character at one or more positions in the string and replaceing a specific substring in a string with a different substring.
Those are what I learned for my assignment library.py week 7.
